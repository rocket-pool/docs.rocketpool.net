# Overview

This section covers the processes of creating and migrating Rocket Pool megapool validators.
This is where you'll learn how to start validating the Ethereum network and earn rewards for it.

## Prerequisites

Before running Megapool Validators, please make sure you:

- Have set up a node machine (or virtual machine) and secured it (via the [Securing your Node](../securing-your-node) guide)
- Have the Smartnode [installed](../installing/overview) and [configured](../config/overview) on it
- Have a node wallet loaded on your Smartnode
- Synced your Execution and Consensus clients
- Provisioned your node with [a withdrawal address](../prepare-node.mdx#setting-your-withdrawal-address), set up your [fallback clients](../fallback) (optional), opted into the [Smoothing Pool](../fee-distrib-sp#the-smoothing-pool) (optional), and configured [MEV](../mev.mdx)

## Guides

[Creating a New Megapool(Validator)](../create-megapool-validator.mdx) explains the process of creating a new Rocket Pool megapool and corresponding validator on the Beacon Chain.
Whether you're making your very first megapool validator or already have some and would like to make another one, this guide will walk you through it step-by-step.
