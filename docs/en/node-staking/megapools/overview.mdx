# Overview

This section covers Rocket Pool megapools and creating megapool validators.
This is where you'll learn how to start validating the Ethereum network and earn rewards for it.

## Prerequisites

Before running Megapool Validators, please make sure you:

- Have set up a node machine (or virtual machine) and secured it (via the [Securing your Node](../securing-your-node) guide)
- Have the Smartnode [installed](../installing/overview) and [configured](../config/overview) on it
- Have a node wallet loaded on your Smartnode
- Synced your Execution and Consensus clients
- Provisioned your node with [a withdrawal address](../prepare-node.mdx#setting-your-withdrawal-address), set up your [fallback clients](../fallback) (optional), opted into the [Smoothing Pool](../fee-distrib-sp#the-smoothing-pool) (optional), and configured [MEV](../mev.mdx)

## Guides

[Creating a Megapool (Validator)](./create-megapool-validator.mdx) explains the process of creating a new Rocket Pool megapool and corresponding validator on the Beacon Chain.
Whether you're making your very first megapool validator or already have some and would like to make another one, this guide will walk you through it step-by-step.

[Stake ETH on behalf of node](/upgrades/houston/stake-eth-on-behalf#stake-eth-on-behalf-of-node) explains how you can use any independent address (a hardware wallet for example) to stake ETH on behalf of a node. Pretty useful if you want to create validator deposits 
without your node having direct access to ETH. 

[RPL Staking and Claiming Rewards](/node-staking/megapools/staking-and-claiming-rewards) covers how to stake RPL to your megapool, claim your ETH and RPL rewards, and understand Saturn 1's new revenue distribution system.
Whether you're migrating legacy RPL stake or starting fresh, this guide walks you through staking, unstaking, and earning your share of protocol revenue. 

[The Deposit Credit System](./credit.mdx) goes over all the different ways it's possible to accrue ETH credit and how it can be redeemed for rETH or used to create new validators.
