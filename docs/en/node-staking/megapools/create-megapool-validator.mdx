# Creating a Megapool (Validator)

Welcome to Saturn 1! A Rocket Pool Megapool is a smart contract instance on the execution layer. 
Your node will manage a Megapool that serves as an Ethereum withdrawal address for one or many validators.
Each validator is comprised of a portion of your ETH, known as the bond amount, and a portion of ETH from the rETH staking pool, 
known as the borrowed amount. Your Megapool is responsible for merging the bond amount and borrowed amount ETH to form 32 ETH total, which is 
then sent to the Beacon Chain deposit contract to create a new validator.
Your Megapool is created at the time of your first validator deposit. Afterwards you'll be able to use the same Megapool to manage as many validators as you wish! You won't need 
to create a new Megapool every time you deposit a new validator. 


::: tip NOTE
The Beacon Chain validator queue activation (and exit) times can vary greatly depending on the current state of the network.

This is outside Rocket Pool's control and is a function of the Beacon Chain itself.

The following tool provides a good estimate of how long you can expect to wait:

Please review this tool to get an idea of how long you can expect to wait for your validator to become active.

## Rocket Pool Deposit Queue 
Validator creation is governed by two queues.

1. The first is the Rocket Pool deposit queue. We'll go more into it different section, but essentially this queue is managed by the Rocket Pool protocol & determines when your validator will receive its borrowed ETH. 
There needs to be ETH available in the deposit pool to match your 4 ETH with 28 ETH in the deposit pool & create the validator.

2. The second is the Beacon Chain queue, which is managed by the Ethereum Beacon Chain & determines when your validator will become active.
Please be aware that the time it takes for your validator to become active can vary greatly depending on your position in each queue & the current state of the network.

The Rocket Pool deposit queue features an express queue system to help existing node operators migrate their megapool validator ETH
to megapool validator ETH.

## Deposit Express Queue

There are two types of queues within Rocket Pool's deposit queue: express queue and standard queue. 

The deposit queue features an express queue system to help existing node operators migrate their megapool validator ETH
to megapool validator ETH. It also creates more predictable deposit timelines for deposits using the express queue

The express queue is processed at a 4:1 ratio which means 4 validators from the express queue for every 1 validator matched from 
the standard queue. 

Existing node operators receive express queue tickets based on their bonded ETH in legacy minipools: one ticket for every 4 ETH bonded. 
For example, a node operator with an 8 ETH legacy minipool gets 2 express queue tickets. This is enough tickets to fully migrate to two 4 ETH megapool validators using the express queue.
[RPIP-59: Deposit Mechanics](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-59#deposit-queue) goes into the nitty gritty of how deposits are handled. 

Please keep in mind that your node will not be refunded an express queue ticket if you choose to dequeue your validator from the express queue! 

## Exit a validator from the Rocket Pool Deposit Queue

If you've had a validator waiting in queue (express OR standard) and wish to exit the queue, you may do so! Your 4 ETH deposit will be refunded 
as credit redeemable for rETH. The steps are fairly simple: 

Use the following command to exit a validator from the queue
```
staker@node:~$ rocketpool megapool exit-queue

Please select a validator to exit the queue:
1: Pubkey: 0x94272f1a4154a54c2d32503d7b98fc792f6d8b543655c62aa47f22b35e92b2ff523ad976b8518289ff3e5e6dbb19b8c5
```
Once you've made your selection and confirm that your validator has exited the rocket pool deposit queue, you can use the following command to redeem the credit as rETH:

```
staker@node:~$ rocketpool node withdraw-credit

You have 4.000000 ETH of credit that you can withdraw, receiving the equivalent amount in rETH. Would you like to withdraw the maximum amount of credit? [y/n]
```
And there you have it! If you would like to deposit another validator, this credit is also redeemable as a validator deposit in addition to being redeemable as rETH.
