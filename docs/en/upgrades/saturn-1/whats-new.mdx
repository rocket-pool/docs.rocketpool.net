# The Saturn 1 Upgrade 

Welcome! This page serves as an introduction to key features included in the latest Rocket Pool Upgrade. Saturn 1 represents the most significant protocol
upgrade in Rocket Pool's history, fundamentally transforming the protocol's capacity, economics, and competitive positioning in the liquid staking ecosystem.

1. **Scaling**: Removes capacity constraints, enabling node operators to run more validators and the protocol to meet greater rETH demand,
2. **Flexibility & Competitiveness**: Adjustable commission structures allow optimization of node operator earnings as market conditions evolve,
3. **Sustainability**: Enhanced RPL tokenomics create stronger alignment between protocol success and node operator rewards

## Saturn 0

[The Saturn 0 upgrade](/upgrades/saturn-0/whats-new) was the precursor to Saturn 1. It was deployed on 28 October 2024, marking the first leap towards the overall Saturn development goals. This upgrade enabled ETH
only minipools by adjusting protocol parameters via Rocket Pool's [on-chain DAO](/pdao/overview). Additionally, all staked RPL became eligible for RPL rewards as the 10% collateral requirement was removed.  

The rest of this page will go over the features included in Saturn 1. 

## Saturn 1: Introducing Megapools

[Megapools](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-43) are featured in the Saturn 1 upgrade. If you're a veteran Rocket Pool Node Operator, you'll know that each
minipool validator is managed by an individual minipool smart contract. 
A megapool is a single smart contract per node operator that serves as an Ethereum withdrawal address for multiple validators. 

The ongoing and upfront gas cost of managing multiple validators and distributing rewards is significantly lower when using
a single megapool contract in comparison to using multiple minipool contracts. 
Legacy minipool deposits are disabled and node operators can migrate their minipool validators to a megapool. 
Overall, megapools should improve the node operator experience and long term sustainability of Rocket Pool. 


The delegate contract serves as an Ethereum withdrawal address and manages validator activities. Node operators can currently choose 
to either upgrade or stay on the same minipool delegates, making it challenging to design future upgrades. The Saturn 1 Upgrade introduces [Forced Delegate Upgrades](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-47), allowing the protocol to 
iterate more efficiently. Forced delegate upgrades on megapool contracts means the Rocket Pool
Protocol won't be hindered by backwards compatibility when designing future upgrades, and gives the pDAO more flexibility to improve Rocket Pool over time. 

## Lower Bond Requirements

Megapools reduce operational cost, allowing Rocket Pool to lower the bond requirement per validator from 8 ETH to 4 ETH.
Lower ETH bonds allow for the same amount of bonded ETH to support a larger volume of rETH and improves the capital 
efficiency of Rocket Pool. In other words, lower bonds allow more commission per ETH bonded. 


| Validator Type | Bond Required | Protocol ETH Matched | Commission Rate | Commission per ETH Bonded |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 8 ETH Minipool | 8 ETH         | 24 ETH              | 5%              | 15%                       |
| 4 ETH Megapool | 4 ETH         | 28 ETH              | 5%              | **35%** (2.3x improvement)|

The bond requirement is a pDAO adjustable parameter in Saturn 1.
This sets the stage for Rocket Pool's future upgrade Saturn 2, which plans for 4 ETH bonds on 
the first two validators then 1.5 ETH bonds on each subsequent validator.

## RPL Revenue Share
In Saturn 1, RPL becomes an ETH-accrual revenue share token. Node operators with vote-eligible RPL staked on their megapool 
earn a share of ETH revenue proportional to their staked RPL. The next section explains how this revenue distribution works.

## Universal Adjustable Revenue Split (UARS)

Saturn 1 introduces [Universal Adjustable Revenue Split (UARS)](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-46), a new 
and adjustable system for distributing protocol 
ETH revenue from node operator commissions. This adaptability allows Rocket Pool to be competitive
as market conditions shift.  

UARS splits ETH revenue among four groups. Each share is adjustable via pDAO governance:
- base commission share to node operators (5%)
- voter share rewards for RPL stakers (9%)
- pDAO share to the protocol treasury (0%, can be adjusted via governance) 
- rETH holders receive the remainder 

Each node operator receives voter share based on their proportion of vote-eligible RPL staked to their megapool. 
In Saturn 1, RPL inflation rewards continue alongside this new voter share mechanism, providing additional incentives for node operators who stake RPL. 

## Reworked Deposit Mechanics

The Saturn 1 Upgrade includes a few notable changes to how the deposit queue for validator creation is 
handled. In the event of a long deposit queue, node operators who wish to dequeue their deposit may so do in exchange for rETH.

The improved deposit queue features two types of queues - standard and express queue. The express queue processes 
deposits at a quicker rate, but requires an express queue ticket for each validator deposit. This structure rewards existing
node operators and assists in the migration from minipools to megapools.

Existing node operators receive express queue tickets based on their bonded ETH in legacy minipools: one ticket for every 4 ETH bonded. 
For example, a node operator with an 8 ETH legacy minipool gets 2 express queue tickets. This is enough tickets to fully migrate to two 4 ETH megapool validators using 
the express queue.
[RPIP-59: Deposit Mechanics](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-59#deposit-queue) goes into the nitty gritty of how deposits are handled. 

## oDAO and pDAO Guardrail Parameters

In addition to revenue sharing parameters, a few guardrail parameters (controllable by pDAO) are being included in Saturn 1 to reduce the oracle DAO and protocol DAO trust assumptions. 
These guardrails serve to improve safety without interfering with legitimate use. 
- [RPIP-58: MEV Penalty Guardrail](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-58): places a limit on the number of MEV penalties that the oDAO can apply to minipools per week.
- [RPIP-61: Balance Submission Guardrail](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-61): during normal operation, the rETH exchange rate doesn't need to change frequently. 
RPIP-61 places a limit on how often the oDAO can change the rETH exchange rate.
- [RPIP-60: Protocol Upgrade Guardrails](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-60): introduces a delay between when a protocol upgrade is passed and when the upgrade is executed.
RPIP-60 allows users ample time to exit the protocol if it changes in a way they do not agree. It also gives the security council power to veto a protocol upgrade.

## rETH Liquidity

Currently, the ETH from rETH mints flow into the deposit pool to be available for node operating matching. In Saturn 1, a proportion of
ETH from new rETH mints will flow into the rETH contract rather than the deposit pool. Excess ETH above a buffer threshold of 1%
of rETH TVL will flow into the deposit pool. This change serves to prioritize rETH withdrawal liquidity by minimizing the creation
of additional supply and allowing rETH burns to better reflect demand. A closer look into rationale and how the buffer size is determined can be found
here: [RPIP-65: Prioritize rETH Withdrawal Buffer](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-65)
