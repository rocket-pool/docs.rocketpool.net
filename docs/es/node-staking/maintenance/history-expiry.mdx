# Expiring Pre-Merge History

All Execution clients now support partial history expiry in accordance to [EIP-4444](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444). Users can substantially
reduce the storage requirements for their node by removing pre-merge block history starting in Smartnode version `v1.17.0`. Feel free to check out
this blog post to learn more about partial history expiry: https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/08/partial-history-exp

::: tip NOTE

    Please keep in mind that the steps to remove pre-merge history depend on your node's selected Execution client:
    - Nethermind users will need a full resync to remove pre-merge history.
    - Geth users can use the `rocketpool service prune-eth1` command or conduct a full resync.
    - Besu and Reth users can perform an online prune while their node continues to attest.

:::

The following steps to remove pre-merge history are for Docker mode nodes only. If you are using an external client in Hybrid
mode or Native mode, please refer to the documentation provided by your Execution client.

Start by opening the Settings Manager:

```shell
rocketpool service config
```

To change the Execution Client pruning mode, go to the `Execution Client (ETH1)` menu and select the `History Expiry` setting in the dropdown menu for `Pruning Mode`

After you've made the selection, press `escape` to return to the main menu, then press `tab` to highlight the `Review Changes and Save` button. Press
the `enter` key to continue. You'll be presented with a menu to preview the changes to your Execution client settings.

Press the `enter` key on `Save Settings` to save and exit the Settings Manager, then enter `y` to restart your `rocketpool_eth1` container.

```shell
Your changes have been saved!
The following containers must be restarted for the changes to take effect:
	rocketpool_eth1
Would you like to restart them automatically now? [y/n]
```

From this point on, the steps differ depending on which Execution client you're using:

        <Tab label="Nethermind">
        Nethermind nodes require a full resync to remove pre-merge history. You must resync your Execution client after saving
        the `History Expiry` setting and restarting your `eth1` container.

        ::: warning WARNING
        If you don't have a fallback node configured, your node will stop validating during a resync. A fallback node will
        allow your primary node to continue attesting and proposing blocks during a prune or resync. Click [here](/en/node-staking/fallback)
        to learn how to configure a fallback node.
        :::

        Use the following command to resync your Execution client:
        ```shell
        rocketpool service resync-eth1
        ```

        You're all set! The node will no longer store pre-merge data, substantially improving the feasibility of fitting a node on a 2 TB drive.
        We recommend monitoring the progress using the following command.
        ```shell
        rocketpool service logs eth1
        ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab label="Geth">

        Geth nodes require an offline prune to remove pre-merge history. You must prune your Execution client after saving
        the `History Expiry` setting and restarting your `eth1` container. Alternatively you may choose to conduct a full resync to remove pre-merge history.

        ::: tip NOTE
        We recommend pruning over conducting a full resync. If you wish to start over with a fresh Geth database or have an issue
        with pruning, you can resync the Execution client using `rocketpool service resync-eth1`. Both choices should result in expired pre-merge history.
