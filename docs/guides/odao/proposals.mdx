# Oracle DAO Proposals

As a reminder, there are two types of Oracle DAO duties:

1. **Automated duties** - these are duties related to routine Rocket Pool operation, such as shuttling information from the Consensus Layer to the Execution Layer, calculating various aspects of the protocol off-chain, and submitting them as updates to the Smart Contracts. Each of these is performed automatically by the `watchtower` daemon process and do not require manual intervention so long as your Execution and Consensus Clients, and your `watchtower` daemon, are all operating normally. You set up the `watchtower` daemon in the previous steps already, so this section will not go over them again.
2. **Manual duties** - these are duties that require your own decision-making and out-of-band communication with the rest of the Oracle DAO to perform. They include things such as voting on contract upgrades, changing parameters, and inviting or kicking members to/from the Oracle DAO. These can all be done via the standard Smartnode CLI. This section describes each of these duties and how to perform them.

Proposals form the core of your responsibilities outside the automated `watchtower` duties.
Essentially, they work as follows:

- The collective Oracle DAO should discuss an upcoming proposal extensively ahead of time, so each member is aware of it and understands what that proposal will entail.
- An Oracle DAO member then creates the proposal via an on-chain transaction.
- The proposal will then enter a **wait period** before voting can begin to have further discussion and form their opinion on it. This is currently **7 days** on Mainnet.
- After the wait period is over, members can vote on the proposal via a simple yes-or-no vote.
- When a quorum of 51% of the Oracle DAO members has voted the same way, the vote is concluded. If 51% agreed to the proposal, it will be able to be **executed**. Any member can execute the proposal once it is approved.
- Execution refers to formally triggering the change on-chain, thus modifying the state of the core Rocket Pool contracts.

## Making a Proposal

Once you make a proposal, it will enter a **review period** where the other members can see it and discuss it, but will not be able to vote on it.
At the time of writing, this is currently **7 days**.

After the review period, there will be a **voting period** where members can vote either for the proposal, or against it.
At the time of writing, this is currently **14 days**.

If the proposal reaches quorum before it expires (that is, if enough members vote in favor of it to reach consensus), it will be **passed**.
Quorum is a configurable parameter by the Oracle DAO; it is currently set to at least **51%** of the total member pool.

Once a vote is passed, it can be **executed** which causes its changes to go into effect.
At the time of writing, the execution is **14 days** after the proposal was passed.

The process for making a new proposal depends on the type of proposal you want to make.
Select a type from the tabs below.

<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Oracle DAO Member List">
      To propose modifying the list of Oracle DAO members, use the `rocketpool odao propose member` command which
      provides the following options:

      ```
      NAME:
      rocketpool odao propose member - Make an oracle DAO member proposal

      USAGE:
      rocketpool odao propose member command [command options] [arguments...]

      COMMANDS:
      invite, i Propose inviting a new member
      leave, l Propose leaving the oracle DAO
      kick, k Propose kicking a member

      OPTIONS:
      --help, -h show help
      ```

      #### invite

      Inviting a member is done via `rocketpool odao propose member invite` which will take 3 additional arguments:

      - The node address to invite (must be a registered Rocket Pool node)
      - The name / label for this node
      - The URL or contact info for the user or organization running the node

      For example: to invite a new member, run `rocketpool odao propose member invite
      0xabcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234 some-user user@example.com`.

      #### kick

      Kicking a member out of the Oracle DAO is done via the `rocketpool odao propose member kick` command.
      It will ask you to select which member you want to kick, and issue an optional fine (from 0 RPL up to the bonded
      RPL amount, currently 1750 RPL).
      This fine, if provided, will burn part of (or all of) the member's RPL bond if the Oracle DAO votes to kick that
      member.

      #### leave

      If you would like to voluntarily resign from the Oracle DAO, use the `rocketpool odao propose member leave`
      command.
      This will create a new proposal so the other members can vote on whether or not to approve your resignation.
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Oracle DAO Parameters">
      To propose modifying the parameters that govern how Oracle DAO votes and membership modification work, use the
      `rocketpool odao propose setting` command which provides the following options:

      ```
      NAME:
      rocketpool odao propose setting - Make an oracle DAO setting proposal

      USAGE:
      rocketpool odao propose setting command [command options] [arguments...]

      COMMANDS:
      members-quorum, q Propose updating the members.quorum setting - takes a percent, from 0 to 100
      members-rplbond, b Propose updating the members.rplbond setting - takes an RPL amount (e.g. 5000)
      proposal-cooldown, c Propose updating the proposal.cooldown.time setting - format is e.g. 1h30m45s
      proposal-vote-timespan, v Propose updating the proposal.vote.time setting - format is e.g. 1h30m45s
      proposal-vote-delay-timespan, d Propose updating the proposal.vote.delay.time setting - format is e.g. 1h30m45s
      proposal-execute-timespan, x Propose updating the proposal.execute.time setting - format is e.g. 1h30m45s
      proposal-action-timespan, a Propose updating the proposal.action.time setting - format is e.g. 1h30m45s
      scrub-period, s Propose updating the minipool.scrub.period setting - format is e.g. 1h30m45s

      OPTIONS:
      --help, -h show help
      ```

      #### members-quorum

      Using `rocketpool odao propose setting members-quorum value` will change the quorum required for the Oracle DAO's
      duties before they are considered canonized.
      `value` here can be a floating point number between 0 and 100, indicating the percent of members needed to reach
      quorum on Oracle DAO votes.

      ::: warning NOTE
      Note that this does **not** affect the quorum required for automated duties such as RPL price and rETH balance
      submission; those settings are controlled by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), _not_ the Oracle DAO.
      :::

      #### members-rplbond

      Use `rocketpool odao propose setting members-rplbond value` to change the amount of RPL required as a bond for new
      members invited to the Oracle DAO.
      For example, entering `5000` for `value` will set the bond at 5000 RPL.
      Note that this does not affect members that already exist; it only affects new members invited after the change.

      #### proposal-cooldown

      Use `rocketpool odao propose setting proposal-cooldown value` to change the cooldown time that a member must wait
      between submitting proposals.

      `value` is a string-formatted time duration, such as `1h30m45s` for one hour, thirty minutes, and forty-five
      seconds.
      It does not accept days; for multiple days, simply use the total number of hours.

      #### proposal-vote-timespan

      Use `rocketpool odao propose setting proposal-vote-timespan value` to change how long a vote can exist before
      expiring.

      `value` is a string-formatted time duration, such as `1h30m45s` for one hour, thirty minutes, and forty-five
      seconds.
      It does not accept days; for multiple days, simply use the total number of hours.

      #### proposal-vote-delay-timespan

      Use `rocketpool odao propose setting proposal-vote-delay-timespan value` to change how long the Oracle DAO must
      wait before being able to vote on a new proposal.

      `value` is a string-formatted time duration, such as `1h30m45s` for one hour, thirty minutes, and forty-five
      seconds.
      It does not accept days; for multiple days, simply use the total number of hours.

      #### proposal-execute-timespan

      Use `rocketpool odao propose setting proposal-execute-timespan value` to change how long the Oracle DAO has to
      execute (enact) a proposal after it is approved.
      If none of the members execute the proposal during this window, it will expire and the proposal will become
      invalid.

      `value` is a string-formatted time duration, such as `1h30m45s` for one hour, thirty minutes, and forty-five
      seconds.
      It does not accept days; for multiple days, simply use the total number of hours.

      #### proposal-action-timespan

      Certain proposals require secondary actions after being executed for them to finish taking effect (such as
      inviting a member to join, then them actually joining).
      Use `rocketpool odao propose setting proposal-action-timespan `value`` to change how long this secondary action is
      able to be run after the proposal is executed.
      The user will be unable to take this action _after_ this window; if the action isn't taken in time, the proposal
      is essentially invalid.

      `value` is a string-formatted time duration, such as `1h30m45s` for one hour, thirty minutes, and forty-five
      seconds.
      It does not accept days; for multiple days, simply use the total number of hours.

      #### scrub-period

      Use `rocketpool odao propose setting scrub-period value` to change how long the "scrub period" lasts (the time
      between a new minipool entering `prelaunch` status and entering `staking` status).
      The Oracle DAO has this long to check new minipools for the [withdrawal credentials
      exploit](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool-research/blob/master/Reports/withdrawal-creds-exploit) and
      scrub them if the exploit is detected, thus ensuring rETH funds are not stolen.
      This duty is performed automatically by the `watchtower` daemon.
      As the check is usually done in a matter of minutes, this value is simply designed to act as an insurance buffer
      in the case that the Oracle DAO cannot come to consensus due to node failure; the members have this long to
      resolve the problem and reach the quorum on scrubbing an exploited minipool.

      `value` is a string-formatted time duration, such as `1h30m45s` for one hour, thirty minutes, and forty-five
      seconds.
      It does not accept days; for multiple days, simply use the total number of hours.
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Contract Upgrades">
      Contract upgrades are currently outside the scope of the CLI.
      The transactions must be submitted manually; please consult the Rocket Pool team if you would like to learn how to
      propose a contract upgrade to the network.

## Viewing Proposals

To view a brief summary of all of the proposals in the protocol's history, use `rocketpool odao proposals list`.
This will sort the proposals by their status and show who proposed it and what it does.

To view the details of a specific proposal, use `rocketpool odao proposals details value` where `value` is the ID of the proposal you would like to view.
This will show a comprehensive breakdown of the proposal's information including who created it, when it was created, the payload body, how many members voted in favor of it, how many members voted against it, and whether or not your node has voted on it yet.

## Voting on Proposals

To vote on a proposal, use the following command:

```shell
rocketpool odao proposals vote
```

This will provide you with an interactive dialog asking which proposal you would like to vote on, and whether you would like to vote in favor of it or against it.
Follow the prompts carefully to complete the vote.

## Executing Proposals

When a proposal has received enough votes in favor of it to reach quorum, any member of the Oracle DAO can then _execute_ the proposal (apply its changes) using the following command:

```shell
rocketpool odao proposals execute
```

This will provide you with an interactive dialog asking which proposal you would like to execute.
Follow the prompts carefully to complete the execution.
