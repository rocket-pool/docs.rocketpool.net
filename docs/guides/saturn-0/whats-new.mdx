# The Saturn 0 Upgrade

Welcome to Saturn 0! This upgrade aims to improve RPL tokenomics in the short term to unlock protocol growth. If you're a returning or prospective node operator, this page will 
serve as an introduction to some new and exciting changes to the Rocket Pool protocol.

## ETH only minipools in Saturn 0 

- The RPL requirement for new minipools is a thing of the past! Minipools in Saturn 0 do not require RPL stake to be deployed.
Node operators can now create minipools with an upfront cost of 8 ETH, which will feature a commission of 10%. In addition, a node
operator may optionally stake RPL to qualify for additional rewards and access voting power within the [Protocol DAO](guides/houston/pdao#the-protocol-dao-pdao). 

- Nodes with an RPL stake of any size qualify for RPL issuance rewards. This unlocks RPL rewards for Node Operators under the 10% collateral cliff 
who were previously unqualified for RPL issuance rewards. 

- This means nodes with an RPL stake of 0-15% of borrowed ETH receive the maximum APY on RPL. Nodes still earn RPL yield beyond 15% collateral, at a decreasing rate.
Feel free to take a look how RPL issuance beyond 15% borrowed ETH is defined in [RPIP-30](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-30#specification).

## New Commission Structure
We're excited to announce that newly launched Saturn 0 minipools will feature a commission structure ranging from 10% to 14%.

- Nodes without any staked RPL will earn 10% commission (5% from the minipool contract, and 5% from the dynamic commission boost).
- Nodes with staked RPL receive up to an additional 4% dynamic commission boost for staked RPL valued at >= 10% of borrowed ETH.

Note that the dynamic commission boost will be reduced to 0% on the 5th reward snapshot after Saturn 1 is released (leaving only the 5% minipool contract commission). This serves to increase the yield advantage of migrating to megapools.

::: warning WARNING
Your node must be opted into the [Smoothing Pool](/guides/node/fee-distrib-sp#the-smoothing-pool) to benefit from the dynamic comission boost. The Smart Node will inform you
to opt into the Smoothing Pool when depositing a minipool if you are not already opted in. *Your new minipools will miss out on additional yield if your node 
isn't in the Smoothing Pool!!*

## Node Operator Guide
If you're interested in running a Rocket Pool node to create your own Ethereum validators, take a look at our [Node Operator's guide](/guides/node/responsibilities).
This is a very comprehensive guide that goes over all of the considerations involved in node operation, including:

- Deciding to run a node locally at home, or remotely on the cloud
- Selecting the hardware for a local machine, or selecting a remote hosting provider
- Preparing and securing the operating system of your node
- Selecting your Execution and Consensus clients
- Installing Rocket Pool's Smartnode stack
- Creating a new Beacon Chain validator using the Rocket Pool network
- Maintaining and updating your node
- Participating in on-chain governance

Both guides will show you how to practice for free on the Rocket Pool testnet so you can get a feel for everything without risking any of your real-life ETH, and how to stake your real ETH on the Ethereum mainnet once you're comfortable with the process.

When you're ready, select a guide from the options above based on your interests.
