# Checking for Updates

One of the responsibilities of a node operator is making sure your system is up to date with the latest security patches.
Automatic updates are convenient but can interfere with your node operation, so it may be preferable to run them manually.
In either case, **you must make sure that your machine is regularly patched!**

::: tip NOTE
Most of the time, updating will not require your system to be down for more than a few minutes.
You might be concerned that such downtime will negatively affect your Beacon Chain balance.
Rest assured, the penalty for being offline for such a short period of time is **completely negligible**.

Each attestation you miss will penalize you for slightly less than the amount you'd earn from a successful attestation.
As a rule of thumb, if you're offline for an hour, you will earn it all back after being online for an hour again.

Also note that there is **absolutely no chance** that you will be _slashed_ by going offline for a short time.
Slashing only occurs if you attack the network, and going offline for maintenance does not count as attacking the network.

**Please keep your systems up to date - don't worry about the downtime penalties!**
:::

## Updating your Operating System

You should frequently check your Operating System's package manager or update service to ensure that quickly apply any new important security patches.
The exact instructions vary for each Operating System and can be found with your system's documentation, but here are a few examples.

<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Ubuntu">
      In a terminal, type the following:

      ```shell
      sudo apt update
      ```

      This will access the package servers and check to see if any of your installed packages have new versions available.
      If updates are available, the output will look like this:

      ```
      Fetched 3974 kB in 2s (1641 kB/s)
      Reading package lists... Done
      Building dependency tree
      Reading state information... Done
      12 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.
      ```

      You can install the updates with the following command:

      ```shell
      sudo apt dist-upgrade
      ```

      This will show you the list of packages that are about to be updated, and if the total installation size is large enough, it will show you the size and prompt you to confirm that you accept:

      ```
      12 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
      Need to get 51.3 MB of archives.
      After this operation, 52.2 kB of additional disk space will be used.
      Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
      ```

      Ensure that you have enough space available to do this, then press `y` and `Enter` to begin the update process.

      Once the progress bar is finished and you're dropped back into the terminal prompt, run the following command to clean up any old versions of packages that were just replaced:

      ```shell
      sudo apt autoremove
      ```

      Next, check if your system needs to be rebooted:

      ```shell
      cat /var/run/reboot-required
      ```

      If the above command prints `No such file or directory`, then reboot is not required and you can skip the step below.

      However if the command prints `*** System restart required ***`, then you should restart your machine to finish applying the updates when you are able:

      ```shell
      sudo reboot
      ```

      Rocket Pool will gracefully shut down and automatically start back up with the system once it reboots.
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="MacOS">
      To update the OS packages, use the UI to select `Apple -> Software Update`.

      To update packages themselves, the easiest way is via `homebrew` in the terminal:

      ```shell
      brew update && brew upgrade
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>


## Updating the Smartnode Stack

Occasionally, Rocket Pool will release a new version of the Smartnode stack.
Updates can contain new versions of the CLI or the Rocket Pool Docker containers, as well as new versions of the Execution and Consensus clients.

The most consistent way to find out about new releases is to subscribe to the Rocket Pool Discord server; they will always be posted in the Releases channel and you will receive a notification.

::: warning NOTE
Note that running `apt update` will not update the node software.
This must be done manually using the steps below.
:::

::: tip TIP
When you have completed the Smartnode upgrade, the Grafana dashboard will still indicate there is still an update available.
It will automatically clear within a day when the system next auto-checks for updates.

If you want to clear it immediately after the update, simply run:
`sudo apt update`
:::

::: tip TIP
If you do not know your CPU architecture, you can run the following command to find it:

```shell
uname -m
```

The output of this command will print your architecture.
**Note that `x86_64` is the same as `x64` and `amd64`.**
**Note that `aarch64` is the same as `arm64`.**
:::

The steps to upgrade depend on which mode your node uses. Select from the options below:


<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Linux (Docker or Hybrid Mode)">
      Stop the Rocket Pool services:

      ```shell
      rocketpool service stop
      ```

      Download the new Smartnode CLI:

      For `x64` systems (most normal machines):

      ```shell
      wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-linux-amd64 -O ~/bin/rocketpool
      ```

      For `arm64` systems:

      ```shell
      wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-linux-arm64 -O ~/bin/rocketpool
      ```

      Now run the install command:

      ```shell
      rocketpool service install -d
      ```

      The `-d` flag tells it to ignore system dependencies like Docker, since you already have them.

      If you'd like to see what's changed, open the Settings Manager - the Review Page will show you what's new:

      ```shell
      rocketpool service config
      ```

      When you're done, start Rocket Pool up again:

      ```shell
      rocketpool service start
      ```

      Finally, check the version to make sure the CLI and Smartnode stack are both up to date:

      ```shell
      rocketpool service version
      ```

      The output should look something like this:

      ```
      Your Smartnode is currently using the Holesky Test Network.

      Rocket Pool client version: 1.5.0
      Rocket Pool service version: 1.5.0
      Selected Eth 1.0 client: Geth (Locally managed)
      Image: ethereum/client-go:v1.10.21
      Selected Eth 2.0 client: Lighthouse (Locally managed)
      Image: rocketpool/lighthouse:mevboost-5ee3bc5
      ```

      Both the client and service should match the new release version.

    <Tab label="Linux (Native Mode)">
      <p className="rspress-directive warning">
        <p className="rspress-directive-title">NOTE</p>
        This will only update the Smartnode stack itself - it **will not** update your Execution or Consensus clients.
        You will have to do this manually (see the next section below).
      </p>

      Stop the Rocket Pool services:

      ```shell
      sudo systemctl stop rp-node rp-watchtower
      ```

      Download the new Smartnode CLI and back up the old CLI and daemon binaries if you need to bring them back:

      For `x64` systems (most normal machines):

      ```shell
      sudo mv /usr/local/bin/rocketpool /usr/local/bin/rocketpool_bak

      sudo mv /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold_bak

      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpool

      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-daemon-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold

      sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rocketpool /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold
      ```

      For `arm64` systems:

      ```shell
      sudo mv /usr/local/bin/rocketpool /usr/local/bin/rocketpool_bak

      sudo mv /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold_bak

      ```

      When you're done, start Rocket Pool up again:

      ```shell
      sudo systemctl start rp-node rp-watchtower
      ```

      Finally, check the version to make sure the CLI and Smartnode stack are both up to date:

      rocketpool service version

      Rocket Pool client version: 1.0.0-rc3
      Rocket Pool service version: 1.0.0-rc3
      Selected Eth 1.0 client: Geth (rocketpool/client-go:v1.10.4)
      Selected Eth 2.0 client: Nimbus (statusim/nimbus:v1.4.0)
      ```

      Both the client and service should match the new release version.
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="macOS (Docker or Hybrid Mode)">
      Stop the Rocket Pool services:

      ```shell
      rocketpool service stop
      ```

      Download the new Smartnode CLI:

      For `x64` systems (most Macs):

      ```shell
      wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-darwin-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpool
      ```

      For `arm64` systems, such as the Mac mini with M1:

      ```shell
      wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-darwin-arm64 -O /opt/homebrew/bin/rocketpool
      ```

      Now run the install command:

      ```

      Both the client and service should match the new release version.

## Manually Updating the Execution or Consensus Client

Each new release of the Smartnode stack will come with updated references to the latest compatible versions to the Execution and Consensus Docker containers.
In some cases, however, you might want to upgrade one of those clients _before_ waiting for a new Smartnode stack release.
This section will show you how to do just that.

<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Docker Mode">
      Updating to new client versions is easy in Docker mode.

      Start by opening the Settings Manager:

      ```shell
      rocketpool service config
      ```

      To change the Execution client version, go to the **Execution Client** category.
      Modify the **Container Tag** setting:

      <img src={tuiEcContainerTag} width="100%" height="auto"/>

      To change the Consensus client version, go to the **Consensus Client** category.
      Modify the **Container Tag** setting:

      <img src={tuiCcContainerTag} width="100%" height="auto"/>

      When you're happy with your changes, save and exit as usual.
      The Smartnode will offer to restart all of the affected containers automatically.
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Native Mode">
      First, shut down your Execution client, Beacon Node, and/or Validator client service depending on what you'd like to update.
      For example, shutting down Geth:

      ```shell
      sudo systemctl stop geth
      ```

      Next, download the latest binary release from the vendor of your client (or build it from source) and replace the old binary with the new one.
      We recommend you **move the old binary to a backup location** instead of overwriting it, just in case the new client has problems.

      Finally, start the client service again - for example, starting Geth:

      ```shell
      sudo systemctl start geth
      ```

      You should follow the log scripts closely after the upgrade to ensure that the new client works as expected.
