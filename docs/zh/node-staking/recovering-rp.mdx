# 导入/恢复现有钱包

如果您已经有一个想要用于节点的钱包,或者您正在恢复之前使用 Smartnode 创建的钱包,本指南将帮助您完成导入/恢复过程。

请从以下部分中选择适当的选项。

## 恢复 Smartnode 钱包

如果您使用 Smartnode 生成了节点钱包,并且只是在新机器上恢复它,过程非常简单。
确保您已经安装了 Smartnode 软件,然后在安装完成后只需运行以下命令:

```shell
rocketpool wallet recover
```

::: warning 注意
如果出于某种原因,您想要恢复钱包但_不想_恢复附加到节点 minipool 的任何验证器密钥,您可以指定 `-k` 标志以跳过重建过程:

```shell
rocketpool wallet recover -k
```

如果您不指定此标志,Smartnode 将尝试恢复您的 minipool 的验证器密钥;但是请注意,在执行客户端完成同步之前这将无法工作。
请查看其日志文件以查看何时完成;完成后,您可以运行此步骤。
:::

这将首先要求您输入一个密码来加密您的钱包。
之后,它将要求您输入**24 个词的助记词恢复短语**。
仔细输入——为了安全起见,它不会显示在屏幕上,在输入时很容易出错,所以请慢慢来。

完成后,您应该看到类似以下的输出:

```shell
$ rocketpool wallet recover

Please enter a password to secure your wallet with:

Please confirm your password:

Please enter your recovery mnemonic phrase:

Recovering node wallet...
The node wallet was successfully recovered.
Node account: <your wallet address>
No validator keys were found.
```

如果您没有看到任何错误,那么您的钱包和验证器将被恢复。

完成后,请确保使用以下命令重启验证器客户端(适用于 Docker 和混合模式用户):

```shell
docker restart rocketpool_validator
```

**原生模式**用户只需重启他们的验证器容器进程。

这将确保 VC 获取所有新恢复的验证器密钥。

## 将现有地址导入为节点钱包

如果您有一个想要用于节点的地址,但_没有_使用 Smartnode 创建它(例如,您使用 MetaMask 或硬件钱包创建它),那么这是要遵循的部分。

::: danger 警告
这样做后,您的地址将成为**热钱包**。
私钥将存储在您的节点机器上。

如果您导入的地址是冷钱包,例如硬件钱包,请注意**硬件钱包提供的保护将不再存在!**

如果您将此钱包用于_任何其他加密货币活动_,**您必须在将其导入到您的节点之前将其所有资金迁移到单独的地址(例如不同的硬件钱包)!只在此地址上留下足够的 ETH 用于节点的 gas 成本(通常 0.5 ETH 就足够了)。**

在将您的地址导入为节点钱包之前,请确保通过遵循[保护您的节点](./securing-your-node)指南中的步骤尽可能地保护您的机器。
:::

此功能仅在 Smartnode **v1.4.3 或更高版本**中可用。
如果您的版本较低,您需要先升级。

这是一个多步骤过程,因此请仔细遵循以下各节。

### Step 1: Add Externally-Generated Validator Keys

**If you don't have any existing minipools attached to the address you're importing, you can skip this step.**

If your address has already been registered as a Rocket Pool node wallet (such as via a service like **Allnodes**) and already has active minipools, and you'd like to import them into the Smartnode stack along with your address, you will need to provide the private keystore files for each of their corresponding validators.
These files will be encrypted with a password of your own choosing, so you will need that password for each file as well.

You need to get these files from the service that is currently running your node in order to import it.
Some service providers may be able to retrieve these files upon request.
If you use Allnodes, you can get these files during your initial setup process but **will not be able to retrieve them in the future unless you saved them during minipool creation.**

Select your installation mode and follow the steps below.

<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Docker and Hybrid Mode">
      First, ensure you've started the Smartnode with `rocketpool service start`.
      This will create a special folder that can be used to hold the encrypted keystore files for your validators.

      By default, the folder is located in `~/.rocketpool/data/custom-keys`.
      If you've customized your installation or data directories, substitute appropriately to find the `custom-keys` folder.

      Check with a file explorer or the `ls` command to make sure this folder exists.
      If not, no worries - just make the folder with the following command:

      ```shell
      mkdir ~/.rocketpool/data/custom-keys
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Native Mode">
      Create a folder called `custom-keys` inside of your Smartnode's `data` folder (for example, `/srv/rocketpool/data/custom-keys`).
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
</div>

Next, place each of the validator keystore files into this folder.
The names of the files don't matter, but they must be JSON files that conform to the [EIP-2335](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335#scrypt-test-vector) format.

The Smartnode will look in this directory for any keystore files you have placed here in the next steps.

::: warning NOTE
The import process will _only_ look for validator keys that are attached to minipools registered to the address you're importing.
You **cannot** use this process to import other validator keys, such as for solo staking validators, into the Validator client managed by the Smartnode stack.

Please see the documentation for running in [Reverse Hybrid Mode](./advanced-config#allowing-external-validator-clients-to-connect-to-the-smartnode) if you are interested in doing this.
:::

### Step 2 (Optional): Test Importing the Address

If you would like to test the recovery process to ensure you have the correct mnemonic and passwords **without actually regenerating your node wallet's private key or importing your validator keys**, you can do so with the following command:

```shell
rocketpool wallet test-recovery -a 0x1234abcd...
```

Where `0x1234abcd...` is the address you want to import, starting with the `0x` prefix.
**You will need your mnemonic phrase to import the private key for your address.**

::: tip TIP
If, for some reason, you want to recover the wallet but _not_ any of the validator keys for your minipools, you can specify the `-k` flag to skip the validator key recovery process.
For example:

```shell
rocketpool wallet test-recovery -a 0x1234abcd... -k
```

:::

The Smartnode will automatically search through the most popular derivation paths (e.g. the ones used by Ledger Live, MyEtherWallet, Trezor, and the Smartnode stack) and address indicies to find the settings that correspond to the address you provided.

::: tip TIP
If you have a custom derivation path, use the `-d` flag to specify it.
For example:

```shell
rocketpool wallet test-recovery -d "m/44'/60'/0'/%d"
```

Use `%d` for the portion of the path that can be iterated to use different indicies.

If you have a custom address index, use the `-i` flag to specify it.
For example, if your address was the 6th one on the standard derivation path, you could use:

```shell
rocketpool wallet test-recovery -i 5
```

You can use both the `-d` and `-i` flags at the same time if you require.
:::

First, you'll be prompted for your address's mnemonic phrase:

```
Please enter the number of words in your mnemonic phrase (24 by default):
24

Enter Word Number 1 of your mnemonic:
```

Enter it carefully, and the Smartnode will begin searching through all of the standard options to find it (unless you explicitly specified them using the `-d` and/or `-i` flags).

Next, if you have private keystore files to import from Step 1, you will be prompted for the passwords to each of those keystore files:

```
It looks like you have some custom keystores for your minipool's validators.
You will be prompted for the passwords each one was encrypted with, so they can be loaded into the Validator Client that Rocket Pool manages for you.

Please enter the password that the keystore for <validator pubkey> was encrypted with:
```

They will be organized by the **pubkey** list, **not the filenames**.
Ensure you know which file corresponds to which validator pubkey so you enter the correct passwords.

Once you've done this, the test recovery process will proceed and report back on whether it succeeded or failed:

```
Searching for the derivation path and index for wallet 0x1234abcd...
NOTE: this may take several minutes depending on how large your wallet's index is.
The node wallet was successfully recovered.
Derivation path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/%d
Wallet index:    0
Node account:    0x1234abcd...
Validator keys:
<validator pubkey>
```

The above indicates a successful test recovery.

### Step 3: Import the Address

::: danger WARNING
If your address is a Rocket Pool node that is _not_ managed by your own self-hosted Smartnode (e.g. hosted by an external service like **Allnodes**), **IT IS CRITICAL** that you coordinate with the service running your node **before you begin this import process** and inform them that you would like to migrate to your own self-hosted system.

You **MUST CONFIRM** that they have shut down validation for your node and **will NEVER resume it**, and manually confirm that your validators are no longer attesting using a Blockchain explorer such as [https://beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in).
You must confirm that each validator has missed **AT LEAST 2 ATTESTATIONS** to ensure you can safely migrate.
Otherwise, you will both attest at the same time and **YOUR MINIPOOLS WILL BE SLASHED!**

The Smartnode will require you to confirm that you have done this before allowing you to proceed with the import process.
:::

If the test recovery succeeded, or if you skipped it, you will next import the wallet and regenerate all of its associated key files.
The process is exactly the same as the above, but use the `recover` command instead of the `test-recovery` command:

```shell
rocketpool wallet recover -a 0x1234abcd...
```

When you run this command, you will first be prompted for a password to encrypt your imported node wallet with.

```
Please enter a password to secure your wallet with:

Please confirm your password:
```

After that, the mnemonic and custom validator keystore password prompts will proceed as they did before.

Once you've entered all of this information, the Smartnode will recover your address and (if not disabled) the custom validator keys for your minipools:

```
Searching for the derivation path and index for wallet 0x1234abcd...
NOTE: this may take several minutes depending on how large your wallet's index is.
The node wallet was successfully recovered.
Derivation path: m/44'/60'/0'/0/%d
Wallet index:    0
Node account:    0x1234abcd...
Validator keys:
<validator pubkey>
```

Your address's private key will now be stored in the `data/wallet` file (e.g. `~/.rocketpool/data/wallet`), and the password for it will be stored in the `data/password` file (e.g. `~/.rocketpool/data/password`).

The private keys for each of your validators will be stored in the `data/validators` folders for each of the Consensus clients that the Smartnode supports.

::: danger NOTE
By importing an address in this fashion, the validator keys were **not** derived from your node wallet, and thus they **cannot** be recovered later by simply running `rocketpool wallet recover` as with a normal node wallet.

If you ever need to recover or import this wallet again, you will need to follow this same process which means **you will need to have these validator private keystores and their passwords backed up somewhere safe.**

If you ever lose them, **you will no longer be able to recover these validator keys!**
:::

### Step 4: Cleanup

At this point, you can now delete all of the private keystore files in the `data/custom-keys` directory.
The Smartnode will have imported them already and assigned randomized passwords to them, so those keystore files are no longer necessary.

Finally, ensure that there is **not** a file named `custom-key-passwords` in your `data` directory (e.g. `~/.rocketpool/data/custom-key-passwords`).
The Smartnode will build this temporary file only during the recover process, and will remove it automatically regardless of whether or not the recovery process succeeded; if for any reason it failed to remove it, it will alert you in the console output.
However, it never hurts to be too careful.

## Next Steps

Once you've imported or recovered your node wallet, follow the next steps in the [Intro to the Command Line Interface](./cli-intro) guide.
